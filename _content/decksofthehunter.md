Decks of the Hunter is a working title for my next book.

I have set myself a goal for this book to write over 300 pages. I really want to dive more into the ideas around some elements of the first book, and really flesh out the world and charcters of Lovecraftian 1920s New Zealand.

You can buy [The Dark that Dwells Beneath Te Aro](https://www.amazon.com/Dark-that-Dwells-Beneath-Aro/dp/B09JVFJKFX/) on Amazon. Please consider leaving a review on amazon, it will help toward my next novel currently in progress.
