# Preamble

---

As part of my weekly routine, Monday's at 7:30pm NZT I sit down for a couple of hours of Dungeons and Dragons from a local D&D crew.
Hosted by an old collegue of mine, [Getting Dicey](https://twitch.tv/gettingdicey) is alot of fun. Just, a bunch of kiwis having a laugh after work.

The twitch stream has been rather successful over the last 3 years, gaining over 900 followers, with plenty of regulars and subscribers tuning in every Monday from around the world (_waves_ to Kyosti).

# The Idea

---

Host and dungeon master Reagan had a desire to introduce something to the channel, something that users could participate and engage with while on stream, but without them having to commit paying with real money.

There are a few ways viewers can support Twitch streamers, either following the channel, which is free, or paid methods such as Subscribing or buying and giving the channel 'Bits', a digital currency on the platform where you can buy a bundled amount and share with any channel you are watching with the click of a button.

Twitch released a few years ago another support method, Channel Points. These accumulate beneath the chat (twitch viewers can interact with Streamers via chat messaging as well), as you watch the stream, you are awarded roughly 30 points per 15 minutes. Viewers can, like Bits, select and option below the chat to spend their channel points on various rewards.

The reweards offered by the system are, what I would consider rather simple, such as getting the streamer to drink a cup of water or highlighting your chat messages to stand out from the crowd.

Getting Dicey has several rewards, inluding aformentioned forcing water down Reagans gullet in attempt to drown him; however, Reagan wanted something a bit more interactive, something viewers felt they could keep or collect.

His idea was Getting Dicey Trading Cards, and called out to his community if someone knew if Twitch had an extension or if there was an extension out there already to achieve his goals.

There wasn't.

Surprising, there are a number of twitch extensions but these are limited to mostly chat interactions. There are also a number of streamers out there who do not release their extensions, becuase there is no monetary gain as all extensions are either private to a channel or free to all streamers on the extensions list.
