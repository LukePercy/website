## In progress

_Decks of the Hunter_ is my working title for the next book.

The goal I set myself for this one is ambitious: **300+ pages**. I want to spend more time on the ideas introduced in the first book. That means building out the world, deepening character arcs, and exploring more of that Lovecraftian 1920s New Zealand tone.

If you’re curious about the first book, _The Dark that Dwells Beneath Te Aro_ is available on Amazon:
