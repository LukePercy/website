## Preamble

I started writing young: one of my teachers decided the best cure for classroom mischief was to park me in the library with paper and a pencil and tell me to write until she came back. I remember getting completely absorbed and coming out the other side feeling proud and, honestly, a little surprised at how much story I had in me.

Most of my writing since then has been practical: proposals, contracts, documentation, and years of video game writing. But the itch to write something bigger never really went away.

## The Idea

During the COVID lockdowns I joined a text-based adventure with friends over Discord. The setting was original, and the game ran using _Call of Cthulhu_ rules. Playing purely in text turned out to be surprisingly immersive; it gave everyone space to describe scenes, thoughts, and outcomes in a way that felt almost like collaborative fiction.

That experience planted a simple idea: retell that adventure as a narrative from my character’s point of view, then keep building outward until it became a complete story.

## Learning to publish a book

I didn’t begin this project with a commercial target. The goal was to learn: write a story end-to-end, then figure out how the publishing process actually works.

My approach was deliberately pragmatic:

-   Write the first draft without obsessing over perfection.
-   Come back later for structure, clarity, and consistency.
-   Get feedback from real humans early.

## Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP)

KDP was the most accessible platform I could find. The thing I appreciated most was how it lowers the barrier to entry:

-   You can start with an ebook, then enable print-on-demand paperbacks.
-   Hardcover can come later once you’ve established the paperback flow.
-   No inventory required; copies are printed when ordered.

The “business” side also taught me some basics around thresholds, royalties, and the slower pace of book sales compared to software.

## The writing process

My pace was consistent rather than heroic: a couple of hours most days, with longer sessions on some weekends. I often wrote the scenes that felt vivid first, then stitched the story together by filling in the connective tissue (dialogue, transitions, and the quieter moments that make the bigger beats land).

## Editing, structure, and feedback

Publishing isn’t a single moment. It’s a loop.

I worked through proof copies, re-reads, and rounds of changes. Friends and colleagues helped with constructive feedback, not just spelling and grammar, but clarity and flow. One of the underrated benefits of KDP is that you can upload revisions and improve future prints, and ebook updates follow along.

## Don’t be afraid to just start

If there’s a theme running through this project, it’s that momentum beats waiting for the "perfect" plan. Start small, write honestly, and learn by shipping.
